 * Navigation routes for the single-activity architecture.

 * Tabs (bottom nav): Pay / Scan / Balance / Settings.
 * History is reachable from the Pay screen top bar and from Settings.
 * Faq is a modal screen reached from Settings, onboarding, and error states.
 *
 * PIN entry is now inline on Pay & Balance — no dedicated route.
